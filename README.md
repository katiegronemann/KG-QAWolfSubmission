# 🐺 QA Wolf Take-Home Assignment

Welcome to my submission for the **QA Wolf** take-home assignment! This repository contains my solution for the [QA Engineer](https://www.task-wolf.com/apply-qae) role assessment. Thanks for the opportunity—I’m excited to showcase my skills!

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This project consists of a script focusing on automating validation for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) using **JavaScript** and **Playwright**.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

To run my solution, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm i
   ```
2. Execute the script:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

## 🛠️ Playwright Automation

The task requires navigating to the [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) page and validating that **exactly 100 articles** are sorted from newest to oldest. My implementation ensures:

✅ **Playwright** is leveraged for browser automation.  
✅ The articles are correctly **retrieved & counted**.  
✅ Sorting order is **validated** programmatically.
